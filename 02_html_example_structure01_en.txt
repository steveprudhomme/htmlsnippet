HTML HEADINGS
<h1> <h2> <h3> . . . <h6> are used for headings
Browsers show <h1> bigger than <h2>
<h2> bigger than <h3>, and so on
People often 'cheat' by using these elements
to easily generate different size text

LOOKS BORING?
The elements are shown using the default browser style
We can apply a different style to make things look better
Let's apply the style used by this presentation
Later we will look at style in depth
